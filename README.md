# reddit_mockup-project

This was the first FullStack project I developed.\
My aim was to have a better understand of how the knowledge I gained from learning coding fundamentals and concepts from Python(3) would translate in a web development environment.

This project is a basic CRUD application I developed with the Django framework and PostgreSQL, and BootstrapCSS(4) for the styling portion.

It is a simple reddit mockup where a user can create, update, and delete their own subreddit, as well as posts and comments in the forums.\ 
The project also includes a simple user authentication and autorization, an upvote feature for the posts and comments, and alert implementation for successful and failed validations.
