# reddit_mockup-project

This was the first FullStack project I developed.\
My aim was to have a better understand of how the knowledge I gained from learning coding fundamentals and concepts from Python(3) would translate in a web development environment.\

This project is a basic CRUD application I developed with the Django framework and PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap CSS for the styling portion.\
It is a simple reddit mockup where a user can create, update, and delete their own forum page as well as make posts and comments in the forums.\
It also includes user authentication and autorization.
